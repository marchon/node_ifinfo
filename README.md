ifinfo
======
More information about the local network interfaces
---------------------------------------------------

This library provides access to more detailed network information about
the interface configuration of the system. It attempts to provide:

* The name and description of the adapter
* It's physical address
* IP addresses and subnet masks
* Default gateways
* DNS server
* Routing tables

Supported platforms
===================
Ideally, ifinfo will support all major platforms in the future. Right now,
it's in the early development stage. The roadmap for platform support is:

* Windows >= Vista
* Linux
* Windows < Vista
* BSD, if the Linux support doesn't magically already cut it

OSX support won't be implemented by me, due to lack of software, hardware
and motivation. Feel free to submit pull requests though.

Requirements
============
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (obviously)
* The dependencies listed in [package.json](https://github.com/raphaelr/node_pcap-ffi/blob/master/package.json).
